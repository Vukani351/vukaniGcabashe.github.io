    pop up will explain how it went, when it started and how it help me get good and how one can make use with it.

2. describe internship and how it has to benefit you and how best you can prep for one, meet one, handle one, and go on from there.

3. Tutoring - good or bad, how it pays and how best can you use it as a learning curve.

using innerHtml or textContent.
