                                Tutoring other who know less thank you is a good way to make money and also to grow your skills, in a way teaching others, helping them face challenges and solve problems with you allows you to learn to work with others, GET 
                                experience with those problems and also get paid. Consider helping others for free and if possible tutor other students for a buck, but this will be great if you do it with something that will challenge you also. This means do not
                                tutor for easy language, and when you tutor other learn the material properly so you can teach very well and pass the correct knowledge.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Another clear way of assisting and possibly getting paid is helping others buy building things with them, whether its helping them build a profile or its building school project, or even just a project for fun, get involved really involved.
                                Work through it and solve the challanges of it, take it really seriously as if its a job and use github with it and have it on your github after you guys done with it, these small projects make for a respectable profile and it becomes easy to employ you.
