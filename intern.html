                            <p>
                                Internship is a chance for you to gather information and experience, more specifically experience that is relevent and worth value to employers, but you also have to give value to your employer while you there.
                                Its important to realise that being an intern doesn't mean you are employed permanent, and also that you have to be focused, dedicated and productive during your internship period.‚Äù So who is it for ??
                                Employers take in an intern who is a graduate or just a person who has self taught relevent skills in Software Engineering, so it's not entirely about degree but proof that you willing to push in this industry.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                My internship was a temporary placement for front end development, it was not my first gig but it was my first mentor guided experience. I had little experience with JS, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Python and C++ from previous jobs, but the 
                                intern gig meant i had to have good pickup skills, I had to relearn everything from scratch and properly, Senior had me relearn JS and Git mostly, I was required to put what I learnt to pacrice building a React-JS + TailwindCss front 
                                end web app, So i started my React-JS & TailwindCss training, similar process went on for Angular and Bootstrap.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Lets walk through few topics that will benefit you before during and after the internship, because it must not only benefit the compony but also you mostly, so lets see how you can use this.  
                            </p>

                                    My job application was crappy from the begginging, i dont have IT degree to show off, nothing but experience we worked on with small apps, so using or creating resume was tricky process not having the flashy things  that 
                                    normally make it look great. The only thing that made my CV worth looking at is Sololearn certificates and experience with previous guys we worked with, for some reason they took me, but i understand it was a risk on their 
                                    part. So I mean to say over all my CV did not look great and shiny, it was mediocre and not much interesting - suggest anyone serious to make a standard and respectable resume, dont be the fool I was.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I just want to make it clear that its important to talor make you resume for that specific job you applying for. Get into the habit of changing the resume as per application making sure the employer sees exactly what they 
                                    need without searching too much. This means make the skills they value exposed, show your experience that relates to what they want, if you have time make it at that moment, I think for this reason its important to 
                                    actualy work on different types of projects this way you have chances with different types of jobs and companies and you can use the positions description to find out what they need and work on it, but please do not stretch 
                                    yourself too thin trying to expand rather try gather these skills but make sure you choosing topics that relate to what you love and already established on. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Your prepairation process for a interview and job can give you or snatch an opportunity from you hands. Major key of acing interview is being honest to yourself. The honestly about what you can and have produced 
                                    actually gives you the confidence that interviewers expect from you. You also need to practice using the tools they use and the technology stack they hire for and show that in your resume, these include:
                                    <br/>
                                    <ol type="1">
                                        <li>learn to read and understand documentation </li>
                                        <li>learn to use github</li>
                                        <li>learn to work with other developers and understand S.E terms</li>
                                        <li>learn to use code editors and IDE's</li>
                                        <li>learn how you learn</li>
                                    </ol>

                                    I will put emphesis on projects that building your profile, work on challenges that have solutions that are marketable, learn skills and solve realistic problems that companies face, use platforms
                                    like <a href="#">geek for geeks</a> and <a href="#">freecodecamp</a> and really try out the challenges there, not only for funu but prep for inteviews and jobs. Its also important that you go to interview with projects that you have
                                    worked on and projects that have challanges that are out there in the field. I want to list out topics that are essentials with links to how you can get training on it.

                                    Understand the people you work with and the employers intentions with you, learn the tech stack within the company and see which you master first and which next. As intern you must be superman/ superwoman interms of learning new skills and putting them to pracice
                                    ofcause you will not learn and master a language fully in a week, but learn to give your self extra learning time, learn to absorb the fundamentals quick and apply them & I mean that in the sense don't read code but write it. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    That skill of being able to use documentation comes into play at this point because the boss will want to see a product of what you have learnt, so you have to focus on understanding docs totally with no short cuts and using it. 
                                    So this might require you asking for help or using you tube, using tutorials, books or even getting a tutor to push you through, because that extra effort is worth it. Its also important to not waste too much time stuck in one thing
                                    instead of asking for assist.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I worked towards showing my boss I am able to learn and apply what I had learnt, I worked towards showing that I can work under pressure and produce whats needed, I also targeted mastering the tools he liked using and understanding what their perks are.
                                    As an intern i think its always important to show the company that you have value and you will serve them well, its also a great way to grow yourself and your skills and experience, so <b>No Slack Time For Intern</b>
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Dont forget that holding that position you still in a probation situation, so you might get the job or not, but if you dont, you want to be prepaired for another job and coming to another interview with more skills and eyes more open. So dont let the 
                                    position give you comfort, don't let the position make you feel entitled and free, always keep growing, learning and producing. I find it works best if you tell yourself the job isnt yours yet so you pushhjard and work for it.

                                    Few things are as fullfiling as assisting someone else with an erritation, a problem you have faced before and fixed, it doesn't only free them but boosts your confidence, and confidence is like 
                                    emotionall and psychological coffy for coders. The greater your confidence the better you code, better yet building a culture of assisting and growing with others pushes a team to grow n produce better code
                                    it also means alot can get done because you dont need to do everything yourself. 
                                  </p>
                                  <p>
                                    As a coder you dont want to be working alone all the time as dealing with savage bugs can mess you up most of these new young coders take bugs to heart and can go from a small issue bug into an over blwon problem 
                                    because they pannic at red lines and lost their mojo, so having someonoe to laugh at it with can take the load of or even produce a solution most times. Its when you calm and relexed that most solutions come through,
                                    or during rest time in the womens/mens room hahahaha!!!  
                                  </p>
                                    So invest your time in helping others solve problems you know and those you have not faced yet, and also invest some effort in getting a code buddy. Code buddies help alot with bugs, bug related stress so to speak
                                    or even plans on how to get something done on best practice standards, and in the long run, code buddy allows you to grow in communication and be easy to work with and thats very important in the field.
                                    </p>
