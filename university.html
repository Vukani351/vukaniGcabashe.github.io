                    <p>University is an enchanting place to be, the buildings, the people, the culture and the loose life style, for none of those reasons i was failing so much, it's only after my second year i realised that i had to take my life serious not the university take matters into my own hands so to speak. I took the chance to make changes to turn things around</p>
                    <p>I failed at making that a reality for all my studies but i did find out howto be good coder while in there and how to make money while doing that, and we will work on this list to see how you can make it practical in your own life. </p>

                            I am going to have to start at the beggining my friends, code is approximately 60% - theory, 20% - creation & 20% - debugging. I say this in the sense, when you learning or preping to create a project, spend your over all time 60% learning the language and framework you want ot use, 
                            absorb it properly and truely understand how it works and why, then when you done with that put that to action by starting the design of what you intend to create then build off, but then understand that your time will be spent moving between creating and debugging.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Whenever you need to do self introspection and learn how to learn, learn how to absorb information properly, too many people do not know how to learn but cram things and try to remember code. Let your learning be a stepping stone towards
                            buildng something, dont let *learning be the final result* let it be the starting point today for what you build tomorrow, So practicalise what you learnt in class, create small projects and enjoy them.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We all find a project that picks our interests, dont even give second thought, just work on it and see what you can create or fail to create also. Ultimately this gets you side effect of understanding and passing, you learn practically.

                            An important part of coding happens theoretically, you digesting the problem, designing and collecting solutions for what you about to face creating the project, but it does not end there.
                            It's important to realise that working on a project is a process, you dont jump into writting code but you have to process what you intend to produce, and whats your starting point, 
                            whats the possible out comes & solutions & what do you know vs what you dont know which you need.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So this is an important understanding because it helps alot of newbies to realise that part of why their projects never get off the ground is because they don't do the pre-code digestion till the project is broken.
                            Projects success normaly is determined before coding process happens, which means it's the prep work which helps make the projects functionality a success, not brute forcing it to life.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Take your time prepairing for a project, digest the problem and its context. Gathering the tools and skills you need to create it. Remove all distractions while prepairing and during coding, Most importantly have fun.

                            Funny enough this is reality that we face when we settled in the work place, a usefull way of growing skills as a young coder is using habits to better your skills. 
                            <ol type="a">
                                <li>If you like games play games that involve code</li>
                                <li>If you love reading read books, articles and blog posts or anything relevent to code.</li>
                                <li>Spend a good amount of time around other coders - preferably ones matured than you.</li>
                                <li>If you enjoy writting work on a blog or some content creation that could boost your confidence and growth</li>
                                <li>If you....you get the picture</li>
                            </ol>
  
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If you take this path seriously and intend to succeed in it, if you intend to make it as a developer you have to make it a habit to think, speak and live a developer life style, 
                            this might not seem like it but it definately helps you be a better coder and a good dev in the long run & it starts with habits, habits make you think like a dev.

                            Few things are as fullfiling as assisting someone else with an erritation, a problem you have faced before and fixed, it doesn't only free them but boosts your confidence, and confidence is like 
                            emotionall and psychological coffy for coders. The greater your confidence the better you code, better yet building a culture of assisting and growing with others pushes a team to grow n produce better code
                            it also means alot can get done because you dont need to do everything yourself. 
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            As a coder you dont want to be working alone all the time as dealing with savage bugs can mess you up most of these new young coders take bugs to heart and can go from a small issue bug into an over blwon problem 
                            because they pannic at red lines and lost their mojo, so having someonoe to laugh at it with can take the load of or even produce a solution most times. Its when you calm and relexed that most solutions come through,
                            or during rest time in the womens/mens room hahahaha!!!  
                          </p>
                            So invest your time in helping others solve problems you know and those you have not faced yet, and also invest some effort in getting a code buddy. Code buddies help alot with bugs, bug related stress so to speak
                            or even plans on how to get something done on best practice standards, and in the long run, code buddy allows you to grow in communication and be easy to work with and thats very important in the field.
